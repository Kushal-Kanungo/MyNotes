1. Switch to the branch in which we want to merge. (**main**)
2. Now merge the brach to main branch.
```bash
git switch main

git merge bugfix
```

When there is no conflicts and mastes branch has not more commit after the **bugfix branch** created on them it is called as *fastforward* merge.

When their is some more commits in main branch but these are not **conflicts** then during merging git will create a **git merging commit** and ask to write a message.
