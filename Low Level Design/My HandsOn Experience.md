I am working on WRScore, Gistly and Notification Service.



"I've been working on something called **Org40Now**, a bunch of apps that organizations use to handle everything about their employees. Think of it like a toolkit.

There are different types of users like regular employees, HR folks, managers, and even higher-ups. They all have their own special access.

Inside this toolkit, there are various apps like **WRScore**, **ALMS**, **Gistly** (for keeping work diaries), **Reflect**, **Notification Service**, and Feedbacks.

Right now, I'm focused on improving three of these apps: WRScore, Gistly, and the Notification Service."


**WRScore** => **WRScore** plays a crucial role in managing employees from their entry to the company all the way through their departure. It keeps tabs on who their managers are during different phases and which specific groups they are a part of. Their Promotions calculating if they are on bench or not.

**Gistly** => It manages daily worklogs all the employees. These can be shared to managers and skip managers. If user want he can share these to any member of the organization.

**Notification Service** => It Notifies all the users for important events to relevant users. Like new onboarding of an employee in a group will be notified to members of that group.
