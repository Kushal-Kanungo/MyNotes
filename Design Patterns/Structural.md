> These design patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality.

Structural design patterns are *Adapter*, *Bridge*, Composite, Decorator, Facade, Flyweight, Private Class Data, and Proxy.

	 - When 2 interfaces are not compatible with each other and want to establish a relationship between them through an adapter itâ€™s called an adapter design pattern. The adapter pattern converts _the interface of a class into another interface or class that the client expects_, i.e adapter lets classes work together that could not otherwise because of incompatibility. so in these types of incompatible scenarios, we can go for the adapter pattern.
