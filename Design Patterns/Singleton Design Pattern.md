- Singleton pattern is a design pattern which *restricts* a class to instantiate its *multiple objects*.
- Class is defined in such a way that only one instance of the class is created in the complete execution of a program or project.
- A singleton class shouldn’t have multiple instances in any case and at any cost.
- Singleton classes are used for *logging*, driver objects, caching and thread pool, *database connections*.

#### An Implementation of singleton class 
- *It must have only one instance.*
- *Instance should be globally accessible.*

#### Initialization Types
- **Early Initialization** : Class is initialized whether it will be used or not
- **Lazy Inititalization** : Only initialized when there is a need for it.
