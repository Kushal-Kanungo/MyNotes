> These design patterns are all about class instantiation or object creation. These patterns can be further categorized into Class-creational patterns and object-creational patterns.

FOR EG. Factory Method, Abstract Factory, Builder, Singleton, Object Pool, Prototype

One Good Example will be:
- Suppose we want to connect to **DB** in our app
- We will create a **singleton** class for it.
- We will connect to DB once and use it everywhere we want to call to **DB**.

##### Some important creational design patterns are
- [[Singleton Design Pattern]]
- [[FactoryMethod Design Pattern]]
