- Family of Algorithms
- Each of them are interchangable
- We **decoupled** the **algorithm** from the one using them.
- So when we need to change something in algorithms like what it does we do not need to change the client code
- #### For eg.
	 _If a  list have a sorting algo built into it we cannot change it but if it follows strategy pattern we change the way of sorting independently._	

![[Normal Inheritance]]
Without Strategy Pattern: Problem arises when to sibling class required same code we cannot share it with normal inheritance

![[Strategy Pattern Implemented]]
After Using Strategy Pattern we can do that

```java
public class Vehicle{
	DriveStrategy driveObject;
	// This is known as constructor injection
	Vehicle(DriveStrategy driveObj){
		this.driveObj = driveObj;
	}

	public void drive(){
		driveObj.drive();
	}
}
```

```java
public class SportsVehicle extends Vehicle{
	SportsVehicle(){
		super(new SportsDriveStrategy());
	}
}
```
Here **DriveStrategy** is an Interface and **SportsDriveStrategy** is a concrete class.
