# 32bit vs 64bit OS

Date: October 6, 2022 1:11 PM
Status: Done

# 32 bit System

1. It has **32 bit registers,** it can hold only 32 data or address, i.e. 4GB of physical memory
2. I can only process 32 bits of data or information

# 64 bit System

1. It has **62 bit registers,** it can hold only 32 data or address, i.e. 17,179,869,184 GB of physical memory
2. I can only process 32 bits of data or information

# Advantage of 64 bit

- **Addressable Memory**
    
    64 bit have 2^64 memory address
    
- **Resource Usage**
    
    Increasing Ram in 32bit do not make any impact in performance
    
- **Performance**
    
    Calculations are done in registers, so 64 bit systems can to large calculations at the same time
    

> 32 bit processor can execute 4 bytes of data in single instruction cycle
> 

> 64 bit processor can execute 8 bytes of data in single instruction cycle

- **Compatibility**
    
    64 bit system can run programs made for both 32 and 64 bit processor
    
- **Better Graphics Performance**
    
    8 Bytes graphic calculations make graphic intensive apps run faster
