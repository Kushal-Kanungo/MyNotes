# Dead Locks

- In Multi-Programming environment, we have several processes competing for finite number of resources
- If resource R is not available (taken by other process), process enters in wait state. Sometimes that waiting process is never able to change its state because the resource, it has requested is busy(forever), called Deadlock(DL)
- It is a bug in process/thread synchronization
- Example of Resources : Memory Space, CPU Cycle, locks, socket, IO.
- How process utilize a resource:
    - Request : Request the R, if R is free lock it, else wait till it is available
    - Use
    - Release : Release resource instance and make it available for other processes
    
    ## Necessary Conditions
    
    - **Mutual Exclusion**
        
        The Resource can be used by one process at a time, if a process is already using the resource the process must wait for it
        
    - **Hold and Wait**
        
        A process must be holding at least a resource and waiting to acquire additional resource that is held by other processes
        
    - **No-Preemption**
        
        The process cannot leave a resource until it is done our it is voluntarily released by process.
        
    - **Circular Wait**
        
        A set {P0, P1, ... ,Pn} of waiting processes must exist such that P0 is waiting for a resource held by P1, P1 is waiting for a resource held by P2, and so on.

    ## Handling Deadlock
    
    1. Prevention or Avoid Deadlock
    2. Allow to occur Deadlock, detect and then recover it.
    3. Ignore the problem altogether and pretend that deadlocks never occur in system. (**Ostrich algorithm**) aka, Deadlock ignorance.
    
    ### DEADLOCK Prevention
    
    1. **Mutual Exclusion**
        1. Use locks only for non shareable resources
        2. Shareable resources like Read-Only files can be accessed by multiple processes/threads
    2. **Hold & Wait**
        1. To ensure H&W condition never occur, whenever a process request a resource it should not hold any other resource
        2. Protocol (A) can be, each process has to request and be allocated all its resources before its execution.
        3.  Protocol (B) can be, allow a process to request resources only when it has none. It can request any additional resources after it must have released all the resources that it is currently allocated.
    3. **No-Preemption**
        1. If a process is holding some resources and request another resource that cannot be immediately allocated to it, then all the resources the process is currently holding are preempted. The process will restart only when it can regain its old resources, as well as the new one that it is requesting. (Live Lock may occur).
        2. If a process requests some resources, we first check whether they are available. If yes, we allocate them. If not, we check whether they are allocated to some other process that is waiting for additional resources. If so, preempt the desired resource from waiting process and allocate them to the requesting process.
    4. **Circular Wait**
        1. To ensure that this condition never holds is to impose a proper ordering of resource allocation
        2. P1 and P2 both require R1 and R1, locking on these resources should be like, both try to lock R1 then R2. By this way which ever process first locks R1 will get R2.
