# Segmentation in OS

Date: October 23, 2022 8:51 PM
Important: Variable logical address allocation | No internal Fragmentation | But External Fragmentation
Status: Not started

# Segmentation

- Segmentation is memory management technique that supports the user view of memory.
- Logical address are divided in segmented in way of user view like a function big its segment will be bigger not like paging where it is fixed
- Each segment has segment number and offset
- Process is divided in **variable segment** based on user view.
- Each segment contains the same type of functions such as the main function can be included in one segment and the library functions can be included in the other segment.

## Advantage

- No **Internal Fragmentation** as segment is divided as required.
- One segment has a contiguous allocation, hence **more efficient**
- Size of segment table is less than page table

## Disadvantage

- **External Fragmentation** as the segment is divided based on user view.
- Different size of segments is not good for swapping

> Modern System have hybrid of **Paging** and **Segmentation**.
