# Paging (Store At Non Contiguous Address )

- It is a Memory-Management scheme that permits the physical address space of process to be **non contiguous**.
- It solves the **External fragmentation** in dynamic allocation
- **Page Size** : It is determined by the process architecture
- **Page Table** :
    - A Data Structure stored which page is mapped to which frame of physical address.
    - The page table contains the base address of each page in the physical memory.
- **Frame** : Frame is in physical address which is correspond to page .
- Logical Address Divided in to two part  **101001**
    1. **A page number (p)** 
    2. **A** **page offset (d)**
        1. Page Number is used to get the frame through page table
        2. Page Offset is added to base of frame address to get to actual location.
- Page table is stored at time of process creation in the main memory.
- A **Page Table Base Register (PTBR)** is present in the system that points to the current page table. Changing page tables requires only this one register, at the time of context-switching.

> Paging is slow because there is many memory references to access the physical memory

### To Improve Paging Translation Look-Aside Buffer (TLB)

- A hardware support to speed paging
- It stores the page and frame address in a key value pair so it will me fast next time

## Problem in Paging

- Pages are of fixed type so it divided our program in parts
- And If they are mapped very away from each other than progrm will be slow
