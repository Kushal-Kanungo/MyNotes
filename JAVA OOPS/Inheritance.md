> Inheritance represents the **IS-A relationship** which is also known as a _parent-child_ relationship.
> 
> The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your current class also.

#### Why use inheritance in java

- For Method Overriding (so runtime polymorphism can be achieved).
- For Code Re-usability.

**NOTE:** Multiple inheritance is not supported in JAVA. Means a single class cannot inherit from more than one class.
