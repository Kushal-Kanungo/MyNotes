#### 1. Static Binding (Early Binding)
When type of the object is determined at compiled time(by the compiler), it is known as static binding.

- If there is any **private**, **final** or **static method** in a class, there is static binding.
- During **Overloading**, compiler can identify which method to innvoke at the the method call().

#### 2. Dynamic Binding (Late Binding)
- During method **overloading**, compiler cannot bind the method call to method defination.
