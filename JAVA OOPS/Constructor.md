There are two rules defined for the constructor.

1. Constructor name must be the same as its class name
2. A Constructor must have no explicit return type
3. A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronised

Two types of constructors
1. Default constructor (no-arg constructor)
2. Parameterised constructor

### Q) Does constructor return any value?

Yes, it is the current class instance (You cannot use return type yet it returns a value).
